## [The Wellvue](https://thewellvue.com/)

Thoughts and Idea:

Limited to probably 150 paid attendees. There is a lot of room for breakouts but main room is 160. 
Would be hard to set up for sit down meals and presentations.
I think we can have 5 - 6 Open Space areas. 
Hotel / Transportation is going to be kinda difficult. We can put folks at the Alfond ($250) and do the Speaker Dinner / Cocktail Hour there or somewhere downtown WP..

## Winter Park Events Center

Thoughts and Ideas:

- Parking is going to suck. There is enough space for maybe 150 cars. We could work with hotels to shuttle.
- Building is cool and the main room can handle 250. 
- Looks like enough room to put tables in the mezzanine.
- Obviously weather permitting but could be fun to have all of that outdoor space too especially for lunches.
- Maybe could do a food truck one day* (or not. Might have to use their preferred caterers only.)

### Cost

- Just an estimate now, but it's about $4800 per day. Their website shows 2p - 1a for Friday - whole building rental. 

### Capacity

- Seated 
    - Grand Ballroom is up to 300 guests in full seating arrangements
    - Rooftop Terrace up to 142 guests. Can use some to serve? Can be reception. Can be Open Spaces.
    - Rooftop Meeting Room - 24 guests. Good location for open spaces.
    - Outdoor Space - 400 on the patio and terrace. Could do an evening movie? Or do a band. Sunset is 6:30
